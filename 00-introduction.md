# Introduction
It's the boring stuff that matters the most. Startup success is not a consequence of good genes, or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned/taught.

Why startups fail:
1. The allure of "a good plan", a "solid" strategy, and "through" market research. These do not work, because they operate with too much uncertainty. 
2. Fail to address management problems.
