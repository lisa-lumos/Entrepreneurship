Entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline, to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity. 

A comprehensive theory of entrepreneurship should:
- Address all the functions of an early-stage venture: vision and concept, product development, marketing and sales, scaling up, partnerships and distribution, and structure and organizational design.
- It has to provide a method for measuring progress in the context of extreme uncertainty. 
- It can give entrepreneurs clear guidance on how to make the many trade-off decisions they face: whether/when to invest in process; Formulating, planning, and creating infrastructure; when to go it alone and when to partner; when to respond to feedback and when to stick with vision; and how/when to invest in scaling the business. 
- It must allow entrepreneurs to make testable predictions.

Because startups often accidentally build something nobody wants, it doesn't matter much if they do it on time and on budget. The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible. 

In other words, the Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight.

The engine of growth. Much of the time in a startups life is spent "tuning the engine", by making improvements in product/marketing/operations.

The Lean Startup method is designed to teach you how to drive a startup. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the "Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop".

Through this process of steering, we can learn when and if it's time to make a sharp turn called a "pivot", or whether we should "persevere" along our current path. Throughout the process of driving, you always have a clear idea of where you're going. 

A startup's vision (aka, destination): creating a thriving and world-changing business. To achieve that vision, startups employ a strategy, which includes a business model, a product road map, a point of view about partners and competitors, and ideas about who the customer will be. The product is the end result of this strategy. 

Products change constantly through the process of optimization, what I call "tuning the engine". Less frequently, the strategy may have to change (called a "pivot"). However, the vision rarely changes. Entrepreneurs are committed to seeing the startup through to that destination. Every setback is an opportunity to learn how to get where they want to go.
