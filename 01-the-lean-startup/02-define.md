This book is for entrepreneurs of all stripes: From young visionaries with little backing but great ideas, to seasoned visionaries within larger companies. 

A startup is a human institution, designed to create a new product or service, under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

Successful startups are full of activities associated with building an institution: hiring creative employees, coordinating their activities, and creating a company culture that delivers results.

A startup is not just about a product, a technological breakthrough, or even a brilliant idea. A startup is greater than the sum of its parts; it is an acutely human enterprise.

It's also important that the word innovation be understood broadly. Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved set of customers. In all these cases, innovation is at the heart of the company's success.

Usually, companies like Intuit, fall into the trap described in Clayton Christensten's The Innovator's Dilemma: they are very good at creating incremental improvements to existing products and serving existing customers, which Christensen called sustaining innovation, but struggle to create breakthrough new products - disruptive innovation - that can create new sustainable sources of growth.

What allowed the SnapTax team to innovate was not their genes, destiny, or astrological signs but a process deliberately facilitated by Intuit's senior management.

Cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management.
