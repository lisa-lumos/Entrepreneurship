This book is for entrepreneurs of all stripes: From young visionaries with little backing but great ideas, to seasoned visionaries within larger companies. 

A startup is a human institution, designed to create a new product or service, under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

Successful startups are full of activities associated with building an institution: hiring creative employees, coordinating their activities, and creating a company culture that delivers results.

A startup is not just about a product, a technological breakthrough, or even a brilliant idea. A startup is greater than the sum of its parts; it is an acutely human enterprise.

It's also important that the word innovation be understood broadly. Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved set of customers. In all these cases, innovation is at the heart of the company's success.

Usually, companies like Intuit, fall into the trap described in Clayton Christensten's The Innovator's Dilemma: they are very good at creating incremental improvements to existing products and serving existing customers, which Christensen called sustaining innovation, but struggle to create breakthrough new products - disruptive innovation - that can create new sustainable sources of growth.

What allowed the SnapTax team to innovate was not their genes, destiny, or astrological signs but a process deliberately facilitated by Intuit's senior management.

Cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management.

The author believes a company's only sustainable path to long-term economic growth, is to build an "innovation factory" that uses Lean Startup techniques, to create disruptive innovations on a continuous basis.

For example, Intuit hold themselves accountable for their new innovation efforts by measuring two things: 
- the number of customers using products that didn't exist three years ago. 
- the percentage of revenue coming from offerings that did not exist three years ago.

Under the old model, it took an average of 5.5 years for a successful new product to start generating $50 million in revenue. But with the new model, they generated $50 million in offerings that did not exist twelve months ago in the last year.

Leadership requires creating conditions, that enable employees to do the kinds of experimentation that entrepreneurship requires.

For example, changes in TurboTax enabled the Intuit team to develop 500 experiments per tax season. Before that, marketers with great ideas couldn't have done those tests, even if they'd wanted to, because they didn't have a system in place, through which to change the website rapidly. Intuit invested in systems that increased the speed at which tests could be built, deployed, and analyzed.

As Cook says, "Developing these experimentation systems is the responsibility of senior management; they have to be put in by the leadership. It's moving leaders from playing Caesar with their thumbs up and down on every idea to - instead - putting in the culture and the systems, so that teams can move and innovate at the speed of the experimentation system."
