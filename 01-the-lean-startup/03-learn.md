# 3. Learn
As an engineer and later as a manager, I was accustomed to measuring progress by making sure our work proceeded according to plan, was high quality, and cost about what we had projected. After many years as an entrepreneur, I started to worry about measuring progress in this way. What if we found ourselves building something that nobody wanted? In that case what did it matter if we did it on time and on budget?

If we wound up taking a wrong turn, I'd have to take comfort in the fact that at least we'd learned something important. Unfortunately, "learning" is the oldest excuse in the book for a failure of execution. It's what managers fall back on when they fail to achieve the results we promised. Entrepreneurs, under pressure to succeed, are wildly creative, when it comes to demonstrating what we have learned. We can all tell a good story when our job, career, or reputation depends on it.

But, you can't take learning to the bank; you can't spend it or invest it.

Yet if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its most vital function is learning. We must learn the truth about which elements of our strategy are working to realize our vision, and which are just crazy. We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want, or what we think they should want. We must discover whether we are on a path that will lead to growing a sustainable business.

In the Lean Startup model, we are rehabilitating learning with a concept I call "validated learning". Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It is a rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere.

IMVU example. In our situation, many entrepreneurial teams give in to fear, and postpone the launch date. Although I understand this impulse, I am glad we persevered, since delay prevents many startups from getting the feedback they need.

Could we have learned those lessons earlier, if I hadn't been so focused on making the product better, by adding features and fixing bugs?

In other words, which of our efforts are value-creating, and which are wasteful?

Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. But in a startup, who the customer is and what the customer might find valuable are unknown, part of the very uncertainty that is an essential part of the definition of a startup. Anything we had done during those months, that did not contribute to our learning, was a form of waste. 

Learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this "validated learning" because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup's core metrics. Validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers.

For example, in one early experiment, we changed our entire website, home page, and product registration flow to replace "avatar chat" with "3D instant messaging." New customers were split automatically between these two versions of the site; half saw one, and half saw the other. We were able to measure the difference in behavior between the two groups. Not only were the people in the experimental group more likely to sign up for the product, they were more likely to become long-term paying customers.

Even after ditching the IM add-on strategy, it still took months to understand why it hadn't worked. After our pivot and many failed experiments, we finally figured out this insight: customers wanted to use IMVU to make "new" friends online. Our customers intuitively grasped something that we were slow to realize. All the existing social products online were centered on customers' real-life identity.

IMVU's avatar technology, however, was uniquely well suited to help people get to know each other online without compromising safety or opening themselves up to identity theft. Once we formed this hypothesis, our experiments became much more likely to produce positive results. Whenever we would change the product to make it easier for people to find and keep new friends, we discovered that customers were more likely to engage. This is true startup productivity: `systematically figuring out the right things to build.`

These were just a few experiments among hundreds that we ran week in and week out as we started to learn which customers would use the product and why. Each bit of knowledge we gathered suggested new experiments to run, which moved our metrics closer and closer to our goal.

The irony is that it is often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a small amount. Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize.

The Lean Startup is not a collection of individual tactics. It is a principled approach to new product development. The only way to make sense of its recommendations is to understand the underlying principles that make them work. The Lean Startup model has been applied to a wide variety of businesses and industries: manufacturing, clean tech, restaurants, and even laundry.
The tactics from the IMVU story may or may not make sense in your particular business.

In the Lean Startup model, every product, every feature, every marketing campaign - everything a startup does - is understood to be an experiment designed to achieve validated learning. This experimental approach works across industries and sectors.
