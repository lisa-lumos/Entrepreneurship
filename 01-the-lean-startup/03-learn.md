# 3. Learn
As an engineer and later as a manager, I was accustomed to measuring progress by making sure our work proceeded according to plan, was high quality, and cost about what we had projected. After many years as an entrepreneur, I started to worry about measuring progress in this way. What if we found ourselves building something that nobody wanted? In that case what did it matter if we did it on time and on budget?

If we wound up taking a wrong turn, I'd have to take comfort in the fact that at least we'd learned something important. Unfortunately, "learning" is the oldest excuse in the book for a failure of execution. It's what managers fall back on when they fail to achieve the results we promised. Entrepreneurs, under pressure to succeed, are wildly creative, when it comes to demonstrating what we have learned. We can all tell a good story when our job, career, or reputation depends on it.

But, you can't take learning to the bank; you can't spend it or invest it.

Yet if the fundamental goal of entrepreneurship is to engage in organization building under conditions of extreme uncertainty, its most vital function is learning. We must learn the truth about which elements of our strategy are working to realize our vision, and which are just crazy. We must learn what customers really want, not what they say they want, or what we think they should want. We must discover whether we are on a path that will lead to growing a sustainable business.

In the Lean Startup model, we are rehabilitating learning with a concept I call "validated learning". Validated learning is not after-the-fact rationalization or a good story designed to hide failure. It is a rigorous method for demonstrating progress when one is embedded in the soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups grow. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. It is the principal antidote to the lethal problem of achieving failure: successfully executing a plan that leads nowhere.

IMVU example. In our situation, many entrepreneurial teams give in to fear, and postpone the launch date. Although I understand this impulse, I am glad we persevered, since delay prevents many startups from getting the feedback they need.

Could we have learned those lessons earlier, if I hadn't been so focused on making the product better, by adding features and fixing bugs?

In other words, which of our efforts are value-creating, and which are wasteful?

Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. But in a startup, who the customer is and what the customer might find valuable are unknown, part of the very uncertainty that is an essential part of the definition of a startup. Anything we had done during those months, that did not contribute to our learning, was a form of waste. 

Learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this "validated learning" because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup's core metrics. Validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers.
