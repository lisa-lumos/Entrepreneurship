# 4. Experiment
Questions: 
- Which customer opinions should we listen to, if any? 
- How should we prioritize across the many features we could build? 
- Which features are essential to the product's success and which are ancillary? 
- What can be changed safely, and what might anger customers? 
- What might please today's customers at the expense of tomorrow's? 
- What should we work on next?

If you cannot fail, you cannot learn.

## Think big, start small
A true experiment follows the scientific method. It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically.

Zappos founder Nick Swinmurn envisioned a new and superior retail experience for online shoe shopping. Swinmurn could have spend long time on testing his complete vision, complete with warehouses, distribution partners, and the promise of significant sales. 

Instead, he started by running an experiment. His hypothesis was that customers were ready and willing to buy shoes online. To test it, he began by asking local shoe stores if he could take pictures of their inventory. In exchange for permission to take the pictures, he would post the pictures online and come back to buy the shoes at full price if a customer bought them online. 

Zappos began with a tiny, simple product. It was designed to answer one question above all: is there already sufficient demand for a superior online shopping experience for shoes?

A well-designed startup experiment like the one Zappos began with, does more than testing a single aspect of a business plan. In the course of testing this first assumption, many other assumptions were tested as well. To sell the shoes, Zappos had to interact with customers: taking payment, handling returns, and dealing with customer support. This is different from market research. If Zappos had relied on existing market research or conducted a survey, it could have asked what customers thought they wanted. By building a simple product instead, the company learned much more:
1. It had more accurate data about customer demand because it was observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions.
2. It put itself in a position to interact with real customers and learn about their needs. For example, the business plan might call for discounted pricing, but how are customer perceptions of the product affected by the discounting strategy?
3. It allowed itself to be surprised when customers behaved in unexpected ways, revealing information Zappos might not have known to ask about. For example, what if customers returned the shoes?

Zappos' initial experiment provided a clear, quantifiable outcome: either a sufficient number of customers would buy the shoes or they would not. It also put the company in a position to observe, interact with, and learn from real customers and partners. This qualitative learning is a necessary companion to quantitative testing. 

## Break it down
The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.

The value hypothesis tests whether a product/service delivers value to its customers. We could survey customers to get their opinion, but that would not be accurate because most people have a hard time assessing their feelings objectively. Instead, we could get customer's retention rate. 

The growth hypothesis tests how new customers will discover a product/service. For example, once a program is up and running, how will it spread among the employees, from initial early adopters to mass adoption? A likely way this program could expand is through viral growth. If that is true, the most important thing to measure is behavior: would the early participants actively spread the word to other employees?

The point is NOT to find the average customer, but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.

What if all ten early adopters decline to volunteer again? That would be a highly significant and very negative result. If the numbers from such early experiments don't look promising, there is clearly a problem with the strategy. 

That doesn't mean it's time to give up; on the contrary, it means it's time to get some immediate qualitative feedback, from the participants in the initial experiment,about how to improve the program. 

This entire experiment could be conducted in a matter of weeks, less than one-tenth the time of the traditional strategic planning process. Also, it can happen in parallel with strategic planning while the plan is still being formulated. Even when experiments produce a negative result, those failures prove instructive and can influence the strategy.
