The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is at the core of the Lean Startup model. We need to focus our energies on minimizing the total time through this feedback loop. This is the essence of steering a startup. 

To apply the scientific method to a startup, we need to identify which hypotheses to test. The two most important assumptions are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.

Once clear on these "not-easy-to-believe" assumptions, the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible, to have a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop, with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time.

Creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact. We also need to get it in front of potential customers to gauge their reactions. We may even need to try selling them the prototype. 

When we enter the Measure phase, the biggest challenge will be determining whether the product development efforts are leading to real progress.

Finally, and most important, there's the pivot. Upon completing the Build-Measure-Learn loop. whether to pivot the original strategy or persevere. If we've discovered that one of our hypotheses is false, it is time to make a major change to a new strategic hypothesis. 

Although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: 
- we figure out what we need to learn, 
- use innovation accounting to figure out what we need to measure to know if we are gaining validated learning, 
- and then figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement.

The goal of a startup's early efforts should be to test their assumptions as quickly as possible. If they are true, tremendous opportunity awaits. If they are false, the startup risks total failure.

What differentiates the success stories from the failures, is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly, and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.

The first step in understanding a new product or service is to figure out if it is fundamentally value-creating or value-destroying. It's also essential that entrepreneurs understand the reasons behind a startup's growth.

You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem, unless you go and see for yourself firsthand. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted, or to rely on the reports of others. (the Toyota Way)

Startups need extensive contact with potential customers to understand them, so get out of your chair and get to know them.

The goal of early contact with customers is not to gain definitive answers. Instead, it is to clarify at a basic coarse level, that we understand our potential customer, and what problems they have. This will be an essential guide for product development, and ensures that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to appeal.

The customer archetype is a hypothesis, not a fact it should be considered transitional, until the strategy has shown via validated learning that we can serve this type of customer in a sustainable way.
