The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is at the core of the Lean Startup model. We need to focus our energies on minimizing the total time through this feedback loop. This is the essence of steering a startup. 

To apply the scientific method to a startup, we need to identify which hypotheses to test. The two most important assumptions are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.

Once clear on these "not-easy-to-believe" assumptions, the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible, to have a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop, with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time.

Creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact. We also need to get it in front of potential customers to gauge their reactions. We may even need to try selling them the prototype. 

When we enter the Measure phase, the biggest challenge will be determining whether the product development efforts are leading to real progress.

Finally, and most important, there's the pivot. Upon completing the Build-Measure-Learn loop. whether to pivot the original strategy or persevere. If we've discovered that one of our hypotheses is false, it is time to make a major change to a new strategic hypothesis. 

Although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: 
- we figure out what we need to learn, 
- use innovation accounting to figure out what we need to measure to know if we are gaining validated learning, 
- and then figure out what product we need to build to run that experiment and get that measurement.
