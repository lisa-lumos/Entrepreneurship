# 6. Test
A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.3 It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.

The gross revenue of a MVP can be small, because we were selling the product to visionary early customers, called early adopters. Before new products can be sold successfully to the mass market, they have to be sold to early adopters. These people are a special breed of customer. They accept - in fact prefer - an 80% solution; you don't need a perfect solution to capture their interest.

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first to use or adopt a new product or technology. In consumer products, it's often the thrill of being the first one on the block to show off a new basketball shoe, music player, or cool phone. In enterprise products, it's often about gaining a competitive advantage by taking a risk with something new that competitors don't have yet. Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it's ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result, additional features or polish, beyond what early adopters demand, is a form of wasted resources and time.

Most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify.

For example, how many features do we really need to include, to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we have to delay the test due to these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time.

The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

For example, Dropbox's assumption is that when it produces a seamless file share experience. However, to prove this assumption with a actual product, it will take tremendous development efforts. Instead, they recorded a video of how the product is supposed to work, and people flocked to their waiting list. In this case, the video is the MVP. 

The concierge MVP. Instead of automating a service using technology, find the first customer first, then work personally with that customer and go through the steps to deliver the service. This helps with learning, and validating the assumptions. Along the way of getting more customers, if a step works, automate/develop the part that work, instead of invest efforts into something that might work in the future. This personalized service is not the product, but a learning activity designed to test leap-of-faith assumptions in the company's growth model.
