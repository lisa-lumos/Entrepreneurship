# 6. Test
A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.3 It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.

The gross revenue of a MVP can be small, because we were selling the product to visionary early customers, called early adopters. Before new products can be sold successfully to the mass market, they have to be sold to early adopters. These people are a special breed of customer. They accept - in fact prefer - an 80% solution; you don't need a perfect solution to capture their interest.

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first to use or adopt a new product or technology. In consumer products, it's often the thrill of being the first one on the block to show off a new basketball shoe, music player, or cool phone. In enterprise products, it's often about gaining a competitive advantage by taking a risk with something new that competitors don't have yet. Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it's ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result, additional features or polish, beyond what early adopters demand, is a form of wasted resources and time.

Most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify.

For example, how many features do we really need to include, to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we have to delay the test due to these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time.

The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

For example, Dropbox's assumption is that when it produces a seamless file share experience. However, to prove this assumption with a actual product, it will take tremendous development efforts. Instead, they recorded a video of how the product is supposed to work, and people flocked to their waiting list. In this case, the video is the MVP. 

The concierge MVP. Instead of automating a service using technology, find the first customer first, then work personally with that customer and go through the steps to deliver the service. This helps with learning, and validating the assumptions. Along the way of getting more customers, if a step works, automate/develop the part that work, instead of invest efforts into something that might work in the future. This personalized service is not the product, but a learning activity designed to test leap-of-faith assumptions in the company's growth model. 

One of the most vexing aspects of the minimum viable product is the challenge it poses to traditional notions of quality. The best professionals and craftspersons alike aspire to build quality products. 

These discussions of quality presuppose that the company already knows what attributes of the product the customer will perceive as worthwhile. In a startup, this is a risky assumption to make.

If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.

Even a "low-quality" MVP can act in service of building a great high-quality product.

Customers don't care how much time something takes to build. They care only if it serves their needs.

MVPs require the courage to put one's assumptions to the test. If customers react the way we expect, we can take that as confirmation that our assumptions are correct. If we release a poorly designed product and customers (even early adopters) cannot figure out how to use it, that will confirm our need to invest in superior design.

We must always ask: what if they don't care about design in the same way we do?

We must be willing to set aside our traditional professional standards to start the process of validated learning as soon as possible.

As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.

The most common speed bumps are legal issues, fears about competitors, branding risks, and the impact on morale.

In many industries, patents are used primarily for defensive purposes, as a deterrent to hold competitors at bay. In such cases, the patent risks of an MVP are minor compared with the learning benefits.

The most common objection I have heard over the years to building an MVP is fear of competitors - especially large established companies - stealing a startup's ideas. If only it were so easy to have a good idea stolen! Part of the special challenge of being a startup is the near impossibility of having your idea, company, or product be noticed by anyone, let alone a competitor.

The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution, and it is those challenges that give a startup hope of surviving.

The reason to build a new team to pursue an idea is that you believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can.

Sooner or later, a successful startup will face competition from fast followers. A head start is rarely large enough to matter, and time spent in stealth mode - away from customers - is unlikely to provide a head start. The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.

Many startups plan to invest in building a great brand, and an MVP can seem like a dangerous branding risk. Similarly, entrepreneurs in existing organizations often are constrained by the fear of damaging the parent company's established brand. In either of these cases, there is an easy solution: launch the MVP under a different brand name.

Startups have the advantage of being obscure, having a pathetically small number of customers, and not having much exposure. Rather than lamenting them, use these advantages to experiment under the radar, and then do a public marketing launch once the product has proved itself with real customers.

Commitment to iteration. You have to commit to a locked-in agreement - ahead of time - that no matter what comes of testing the MVP, you will not give up hope.

The MVP is just the first step on a journey of learning.

Down that road - after many iterations - you may learn that some element of your product or strategy is flawed and decide it is time to make a change, which I call a pivot, to a different method for achieving your vision.

We all need a disciplined, systematic approach to figuring out if we're making progress and discovering if we're actually achieving validated learning. I call this system innovation accounting, an alternative to traditional accounting designed specifically for startups.
