# 9. Batch
Product releases incur overhead, and so from an efficiency point of view, releasing often leaves less time to devote to building the product. However, waiting too long to release can lead to the ultimate waste: making something that nobody wants.

How much time and energy should companies invest in infrastructure and planning early on in anticipation of success? Spend too much and you waste precious time that could have been spent learning. Spend too little and you may fail to take advantage of early success and cede market leadership to a fast follower.

Startups need organizational structures that combat the extreme uncertainty that is a startup's chief enemy.

Value in a startup is not the creation of stuff, but rather validated learning about how to build a sustainable business.

What products do customers really want? How will our business grow? Who is our customer? Which customers should we listen to and which should we ignore? These are the questions that need answering as quickly as possible to maximize a startup's chances of success. That is what creates value for a startup.

With the proper foundation, Lean Startups can grow to become lean enterprises that maintain their agility, learning orientation, and culture of innovation even as they scale.

An advantage of a successful startup's rapid growth is that the company can keep its entrepreneurial DNA even as it matures.

The "one envelope at a time approach" is a faster way of getting the job done, even though it seems inefficient. The one envelope at a time approach is called single-piece flow in lean manufacturing.

Single-piece flow is so named because it has a batch size of one.

Why does stuffing one envelope at a time get the job done faster even though it seems like it would be slower? Because our intuition doesn't take into account the extra time required to sort, stack, and move around the large piles of half-complete envelopes when it's done the other way.

It seems more efficient to repeat the same task over and over, in part because we expect that we will get better at this simple task the more we do it. Unfortunately, in process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system.

Even if the amount of time that each process took was exactly the same, the small batch production approach still would be superior, and for even more counterintuitive reasons. For example, imagine that the letters didn't fit in the envelopes. With the large-batch approach, we wouldn't find that out until nearly the end. What if the envelopes are defective and won't seal?

The small-batch approach produces a finished product every few seconds, whereas the large-batch approach must deliver all the products at once, at the end.

Imagine what this might look like if the time horizon was hours, days, or weeks. What if it turns out that the customers have decided they don't want the product? Which process would allow a company to find this out sooner?

Instead of buying large specialized machines that could produce thousands of parts at a time, Toyota used smaller general-purpose machines that could produce a wide variety of parts in small batches.

This required figuring out ways to reconfigure each machine rapidly to make the right part at the right time.

Shigeo Shingo was so relentless in rethinking the way machines were operated that he was able to reduce changeover times that previously took hours to less than ten minutes. He did this, not by asking workers to work faster, but by reimagining and restructuring the work that needed to be done.

Because of its smaller batch size, Toyota was able to produce a much greater diversity of products. It was no longer necessary that each product be exactly the same to gain the economies of scale that powered mass production. Thus, Toyota could serve its smaller, more fragmented markets and still compete with the mass producers. Over time, that capability allowed Toyota to move successfully into larger and larger markets until it became the world's largest automaker in 2008.

The biggest advantage of working in small batches is that quality problems can be identified much sooner.

In the Lean Startup the goal is not to produce more stuff efficiently. It is to as quickly as possible learn how to build a sustainable business.

Working in small batches ensures that a startup can minimize the expenditure of time, money, and effort that ultimately turns out to have been wasted.

Instead of working in separate departments, engineers and designers would work together side by side on one feature at a time.

Whenever that feature was ready to be tested with customers, they immediately would release a new version of the product, which would go live on our website for a relatively small number of people.

The team would be able immediately to assess the impact of their work, evaluate its effect on customers, and decide what to do next.

IMVU used an elaborate set of defense mechanisms that prevented engineers from accidentally breaking something important.

Imagine that instead of removing the button altogether, an engineer makes a mistake and changes the button's color so that it is now white on a white background. From the point of view of automated functional tests, the button is still there and everything is working normally; from the customer's point of view, the button is gone, and so nobody can buy anything. This class of problems is hard to detect solely with automation but is still catastrophic from a business point of view.

At IMVU, our immune system is programmed to detect these business consequences and automatically invoke our equivalent of the andon cord. When our immune system detects a problem, a number of things happen immediately: 
1. The defective change is removed immediately and automatically. 
2. Everyone on the relevant team is notified of the problem. 
3. The team is blocked from introducing any further changes, preventing the problem from being compounded by future mistakes
4. Until the root cause of the problem is found and fixed.

by reducing batch size, we can get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop more quickly than our competitors can. The ability to learn faster from customers is the essential competitive advantage that startups must possess.

We had been working for months on a new version of a really cool product. The original version had been years in the making, and expectations for the next release were incredibly high. But the longer we worked, the more afraid we became of how customers would react when they finally saw the new version. As our plans became more ambitious, so too did the number of bugs, conflicts, and problems we had to deal with.

In manufacturing, pull is used primarily to make sure production processes are tuned to levels of customer demand. Without this, factories can wind up making much more, or much less, of a product than customers really want.

Customers often don't know what they want.

Our goal in building products is to be able to run experiments that will help us learn how to build a sustainable business.

As soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product development team should be engineered to design and run this experiment as quickly as possible, using the smallest batch size that will get the job done.

Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste.

The Lean Startup works only if we are able to build an organization as adaptable and fast as the challenges it faces.
