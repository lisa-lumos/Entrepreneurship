# 11. Adapt
As the company grew, we would need additional processes and systems designed to coordinate the company's operations at each larger size.

The overarchitecture failure, in which attempting to prevent all the various kinds of problems that could occur wound up delaying the company from putting out any product.

The Friendster effect - suffering a high-profile technical failure just when customer adoption is going wild.

The higher-quality the existing playbook is, the easier it will be for it to evolve over time. By contrast, a low-quality playbook will be filled with contradictory or ambiguous rules that cause confusion when anything is changed.

The more features we added to the product, the harder it became to add even more, because of the risk that a new feature would interfere with an existing feature.

In a service business, since any new rules may conflict with existing rules, and the more rules, the more possibilities for conflict.

At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be.

For example, suppose a machine stopped functioning: 
1. Why did the machine stop? (There was an overload and the fuse blew.) 
2. Why was there an overload? (The bearing was not sufficiently lubricated.) 
3. Why was it not lubricated sufficiently? (The lubrication pump was not pumping sufficiently.) 
4. Why was it not pumping sufficiently? (The shaft of the pump was worn and rattling.) 
5. Why was the shaft worn out? (There was no strainer attached and metal scrap got in.) 

Repeating "why" five times, like this, can help uncover the root problem and correct it.

By asking and answering "why" five times, we can get to the real cause of the problem, which is often hidden behind more obvious symptoms.

Even in Ohno's relatively simple example the root cause moves away from a technical fault (a blown fuse) and toward a human error (someone forgot to attach a strainer). This is completely typical of most problems that startups face, no matter what industry they are in.

The investment should be smaller when the symptom is minor, and larger when the symptom is more painful. We don't make large investments in prevention unless we're coping with large problems.

If the outage is a minor glitch, it's essential that we make only a minor investment in fixing it. Let's do the first hour of the eight-week plan. That may not sound like much, but it's a start. If the problem recurs, asking the Five Whys will require that we continue to make progress on it.

At no point did we drop everything to focus solely on training. Instead, we made incremental improvements to the process constantly, each time reaping incremental benefits.

The Five Whys approach acts as a natural speed regulator. The more problems you have, the more you invest in solutions to those problems.

With startups in particular, there is a danger that teams will work too fast, trading quality for time in a way that causes sloppy mistakes. Five Whys prevents that, allowing teams to find their optimal pace.

Startup teams should go through the Five Whys whenever they encounter any kind of failure, including technical faults, failures to achieve business results, or unexpected changes in customer behavior.

It provides the foundation a company needs to respond quickly to problems as they appear, without overinvesting or overengineering.

The Five Blames. Instead of asking why repeatedly in an attempt to understand what went wrong, frustrated teammates start pointing fingers at each other, trying to decide who is at fault.

The goal of the Five Whys is to help us see the objective truth that chronic problems are caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly.

Make sure that everyone affected by the problem is in the room during the analysis of the root cause. It should include anyone who tried to fix the symptom as well as anyone who worked on the subsystems or features involved.

In my experience, whoever is left out of the discussion ends up being the target for blame.

When blame inevitably arises, the most senior people in the room should repeat this mantra: if a mistake happens, shame on us for making it so easy to make that mistake.

At IMVU we told new hires, "If our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very first day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so."

If they did manage to break it, we immediately would have them lead the effort to fix the problem as well as the effort to prevent the next person from repeating their mistake.

Bit by bit, system by system, those small investments added up to a robust product development process that allowed all our employees to work more creatively, with greatly reduced fear.

The Five Whys requires an environment of mutual trust and empowerment. In situations in which this is lacking, I ask teams to adopt these simple rules: 
1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time. 
2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

The strength and weakness of the simplified system is that it invites questions such as What counts as the same problem? What kinds of mistakes should we focus on? and Should we fix this individual problem or try to prevent a whole category of related problems?

For a team that is just getting started, these questions are thought-provoking and can lay the groundwork for more elaborate methods to come. Ultimately, though, they do need answering.

At all these junctures, it is essential that someone with sufficient authority be present to insist that the process be followed, that its recommendations be implemented, and to act as a referee if disagreements flare up.

Once you are ready to begin, I recommend starting with a narrowly targeted class of symptoms.

It's better to give the team a chance to learn how to do the process first and then expand into higher-stakes areas later.

Instead, keep the meetings short and pick relatively simple changes at each of the five levels of the inquiry. Over time, as the team gets more comfortable with the process, you can expand it to include more and more types of billing complaints and then to other kinds of problems.

To facilitate learning, I have found it helpful to appoint a Five Whys master for each area in which the method is being used. This individual is tasked with being the moderator for each Five Whys meeting, making decisions about which prevention steps to take, and assigning the follow-up work from that meeting.

This is a classic case of "achieving failure" - successfully executing a flawed plan. Since it is measuring core customer satisfaction, it is not subject to minor fluctuations; it registers only major changes in customer sentiment.

"Organizations have muscle memory," and it is hard for people to unlearn old habits.

Instead of focusing on new deadlines, Greg and Himanshu invested in process, product, and technology changes that enabled working in smaller batches.

There were three differences in year three:
- Teams were involved in creating new technologies, processes, and systems.
- Cross-functional teams were formed around new great ideas.
- Customers were involved from the inception of each feature concept.

Earlier customer feedback and a faster development cycle that was decoupled from the annual release time line. They repeatedly emphasized that the new approach was how startup competitors were working and iterating. They had to follow suit or risk becoming irrelevant.

Now no team is bigger than five people. The focus of each team is iterating with customers as rapidly as possible, running experiments, and then using validated learning to make real-time investment decisions about what to work on.

Each team works on a new feature for approximately six weeks end to end, testing it with real customers throughout the process.

To achieve lasting change, the QuickBooks team had to invest in tools and platform changes that would enable the new, faster way of working.

As usual, there are possibilities that go beyond technical solutions. For example, the annual sales cycle of boxed desktop software is a significant barrier to truly rapid learning, and so the team has begun experimenting with subscription-based products for the most active customers.

Lean Startups, when they grow up, are well positioned to develop operational excellence based on lean principles. They already know how to operate with discipline, develop processes that are tailor-made to their situation, and use lean techniques such as the Five Whys and small batches. 

As a successful startup makes the transition to an established company, it will be well poised to develop the kind of culture of disciplined execution that characterizes the world's best firms, such as Toyota.

Even established companies must struggle to find new sources of growth through disruptive innovation.

Both successful startups and established companies alike must learn to juggle multiple kinds of work at the same time, pursuing operational excellence and disruptive innovation.
