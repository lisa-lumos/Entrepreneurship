# 12. Innovate
As startups grow, entrepreneurs can build organizations that learn how to balance the needs of existing customers with the challenges of finding new customers to serve, managing existing lines of business, and exploring new business models -  all at the same time.

Internal or external, in my experience startup teams require three structural attributes: scarce but secure resources, independent authority to develop their business, and a personal stake in the outcome.

Startups are both easier and more demanding to run than traditional divisions: they require much less capital overall, but that capital must be absolutely secure from tampering.

Startup teams need complete autonomy to develop and market new products within their limited mandate. They have to be able to conceive and execute experiments without having to gain an excessive number of approvals.

Startup teams should have full-time representation from every functional department in the company that will be involved in the creation or launch of their early products.

Handoffs and approvals slow down the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop and inhibit both learning and accountability. Startups require that they be kept to an absolute minimum.

Entrepreneurs need a personal stake in the outcome of their creations. In stand-alone new ventures, this usually is achieved through stock options or other forms of equity ownership. Where a bonus system must be used instead, the best incentives are tied to the long-term performance of the new innovation.

I do not believe that a personal stake has to be financial. This is especially important in organizations, such as nonprofits and government. 

The parent organization has to make it clear who the innovator is and make sure the innovator receives credit for having brought the new product to life-if it is successful.

Toyota employees translate the term as chief engineer, and they refer to the vehicle under development as the shusa's car. They assured us that the shusa has final, absolute authority over every aspect of vehicle development.

It is important to focus on establishing the ground rules under which autonomous startup teams operate: how to protect the parent organization, how to hold entrepreneurial managers accountable, and how to reintegrate an innovation back into the parent organization if it is successful.

It is unfair to criticize these managers for their response; the criticism should be aimed at senior executives who failed to design a supportive system in which to operate and innovate.

My suggested solution is to create a sandbox for innovation that will contain the impact of the new innovation but not constrain the methods of the startup team. It works as follows:
1. Any team can create a true split-test experiment that affects only the sandboxed parts of the product or service (for a multipart product) or only certain customer segments or territories (for a new product). However:
2. One team must see the whole experiment through from end to end.
3. No experiment can run longer than a specified amount of time (usually a few weeks for simple feature experiments, longer for more disruptive innovations).
4. No experiment can affect more than a specified number of customers (usually expressed as a percentage of the company's total mainstream customer base).
5. Every experiment has to be evaluated on the basis of a single standard report of five to ten (no more) actionable metrics.
6. Every team that works inside the sandbox and every product that is built must use the same metrics to evaluate success.
7. Any team that creates an experiment must monitor the metrics and customer reactions (support calls, social media reaction, forum threads, etc.) while the experiment is in progress and abort it if something catastrophic happens.

For example, an online service might restrict it to certain pages or user flows. A retail operation might restrict it to certain stores or geographic areas. Companies trying to bring an entirely new product to market might build the restriction around customers in certain segments.

The innovation team should be cross-functional and have a clear team leader, like the Toyota shusa. It should be empowered to build, market, and deploy products or features in the sandbox without prior approval. It should be required to report on the success or failure of those efforts by using standard actionable metrics and innovation accounting.

As new mainstream customers are acquired and new markets are conquered, the product becomes part of the public face of the company, with important implications for PR, marketing, sales, and business development. In most cases, the product will attract competitors: copycats, fast followers, and imitators of all stripes.

To combat the inevitable commoditization of the product in its market, line extensions, incremental upgrades, and new forms of marketing are essential.
In this phase, operational excellence takes on a greater role, as an important way to increase margins is to lower costs.

The problem for startups and large companies alike is that employees often follow the products they develop as they move from phase to phase. A common practice is for the inventor of a new product or feature to manage the subsequent resources, team, or division that ultimately commercializes it. As a result, strong creative managers wind up getting stuck working on the growth and optimization of products rather than creating new ones.

When products move from phase to phase, they are handed off between teams. Employees can choose to move with the product as part of the handoff, or stay behind and begin work on something new. Neither choice is necessarily right or wrong; it depends on the temperament and skills of the person in question.

After an entrepreneur has incubated a product in the innovation sandbox, it has to be reintegrated into the parent organization.

Working in the innovation sandbox is like developing startup muscles. At first, the team will be able to take on only modest experiments.

It does not matter how fast we can build. It does not matter how fast we can measure. What matters is how fast we can get through the entire loop.

Switching to validated learning feels worse before it feels better.

If it is known that this loss of productivity is an inevitable part of the transition, it can be managed actively.

There is a thriving community of Lean Startup meetups around the world as well as online, and suggestions for how you can take advantage of these resources listed in the last chapter of this book, "Join the Movement."
