# 13. Epilogue: Waste not
Taylor invented modern white-collar work that sees companies as systems that must be managed at more than the level of the individual.

We can see and feel the waste of material things. Awkward, inefficient, or ill-directed movements of men, however, leave nothing visible or tangible behind them.

For all of our vaunted efficiency in the making of things, our economy is still incredibly wasteful. This waste comes not from the inefficient organization of work but rather from working on the wrong things-and on an industrial scale.

"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all."

We believe that most forms of waste in innovation are preventable once their causes are understood.

By focusing on functional efficiency, we lose sight of the real goal of innovation: to learn that which is currently unknown.

"Knowing Lean Startup principles makes me feel like I have superpowers. Even though I'm just a junior employee, when I meet with corporate VPs and GMs in my large company, I ask them simple questions and very quickly help them see how their projects are based on fundamental hypotheses that are testable. In minutes, I can lay out a plan they could follow to scientifically validate their plans before it's too late. They consistently respond with 'Wow, you are brilliant. We've never thought to apply that level of rigor to our thinking about new products before.'"

We routinely green-light new projects more on the basis of intuition than facts. That is not the root cause of the problem. All innovation begins with vision. It's what happens next that is critical.

Only by building a model of customer behavior and then showing our ability to use our product or service to change it over time can we establish real facts about the validity of our vision.

Everyone would insist that assumptions be stated explicitly and tested rigorously not as a stalling tactic or a form of make-work, but out of a genuine desire to discover the truth that underlies every project's vision.
